### About myself
My name is **Basetana Baholo**. I turned 26 on the 17 March. I hate **_milk_** (my bones are suffering for it). I love music.

**The image represents me all day, everyday!.**


I recently found out that data engineers are responsibile for the creation of the **"read_csv"** function that data scientists get to use and, of course, I was blown away because to me it just seemed like a built-in function. But knowing that someone is ensuring that someone else can do their work more efficiently is awesome. So that's one of the reasons why I'm here. 

ohh and Queen is the best band to ever exists!
